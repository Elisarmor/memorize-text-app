Most flash card/memorization apps focus on helping you memorize one fact at a time.  This one is focused on memorizing passages of text.

# Working with the code

To get started, fork/clone the repository, and then:

```sh
npm i
```

To run the development server so you can easily test the app while working on code:

```

To generate a production build:

The entry point of the app code is `client/index.js`.  The running application is served out of `public/`.
